Aurora is a Discord.js bot to detect patterns of emotional distress or suicidal crisis. Server administrators will be notifed to review the message content and can send helpful information and support links to the user with a single button press.

If youâ€™re in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, find help in your area with Find a helpline. https://findahelpline.com/i/iasp

If you believe that someone else is in danger of suicide and you have their contact information, contact your local law enforcement for immediate help. You can also encourage the person to contact a suicide prevention hotline using the information above.
