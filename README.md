# aurora-bot
A private channel will be created to notify Server Administrators when concerning content is detected in a user's message. An Administrator can review the message and send support links to the user via DMs with a single button press. A direct URL to the message is attached to assist with reporting the message to Discord's Trust & Safety team.

To view logs, you must have the 'Administrator' permission.

The content of your user's messages will be compared to a database of known suicidal messages. This database will be improved over time.

Aurora will ask for minimal permissions upon joining your server. It will only have access to public channels & the private aurora-logs channel in order to notify your Administrators of concerning messages. If you'd like to grant the bot further permissions or channel access, you must do so yourself.

Aurora will never contact users without explicit permission from an Administrator, reveal the identity of the Administrator or use the server for any forms of solicitation. The content of the server (including flagged messages) are not stored, logged or forwarded. If you feel that someone's life is in danger, you must forward this information to the proper authorities yourself.

If youâ€™re in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, find help in your area with 'Find a helpline' https://findahelpline.com/i/iasp

If you believe that someone else is in danger of suicide and you have their contact information, contact your local law enforcement for immediate help. You can also encourage the person to contact a suicide prevention hotline using the information above.
